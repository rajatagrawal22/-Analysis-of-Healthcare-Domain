 According to the National Centre for Health 
Statistics in the USA, the number of deaths due to chronic 
diseases in the US has increased drastically over the last 10 
years. In this project, we will analyse the patrons of the most 
deadly diseases in the USA and the health care insurance 
coverages available for the citizens. It is expected that this 
analysis will help any health institution to have clearer 
expectations of the challenges that are currently happening at 
the Health sector so that they may have measures and 
solutions with a better approach.
For the analysis path process, firstly it was collected the 
datasets from an open and reliable data sources, such as 
the US governmental data catalogue, where it was possible 
to extract the required data in XML format, then Mongo dB 
was used to collect the data in a more familiar way such as a 
CSV format. Once the datasets were loaded, the data cleaning 
a pre-processing part was done using Python, and after that 
the data bases were imported into PostgreSQL so this way 
was possible to create relational tables among the database. 
Once the ETL process was accomplished, finally for the 
visualization process we used Python and Power BI, creating 
different graphs and plots to achieve a quick and easy 
understanding of the data.
